# Employee Benefits

The following section lists Lullabot Education's benefits and describes each. If you have specific questions about a benefit, feel free to email the CEO or our Insperity representative.

## Wait, what's Insperity?
For our U.S. employees we have partnered with Insperity to provide payroll and employee benefits. This means that for the U.S. folks Insperity will handle most of your employee paperwork and serve as the support system for your benefits plans.

## Summary of benefits
This is a quick overview of the main benefits we offer. You will find details for each of these in the rest of this section of the handbook.

**Leave**
We provide 5 weeks (25 days) of paid vacation and 10 paid holidays per year (based on your country of residence). We also offer 6 weeks of paid parental leave, with an optional, additional 6 weeks of unpaid leave. Personal Days can be used for situations that do not fall under another leave type (e.g. sick days, family need, moving, household emergencies), and they do not have a set limit like other leave types. There are other forms of leave as well, including time for bereavement, conference attendance, jury duty, and military service.

**Insurance**
We provide medical, dental, and vision coverage in the US, and can arrange for equivalent coverage in other countries as needed. We also pay for $50,000 life insurance coverage, and you may elect to take more. Our disability plan goes into effect if you are unfit for work for more than 2 weeks and will cover 60% of your salary.

**Retirement**
We have 401(k) plans set up in the US, and will match up to 4% of your own retirement contributions. We provide equivalent matching for non-US plans.

**Tech and Office Stipend**
We give you $200 per month, tax free, towards buying office equipment and software for work.
