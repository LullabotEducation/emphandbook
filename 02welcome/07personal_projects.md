# Personal Projects

Once a year you can choose to take 1 month to focus on a work-related project that lets you tackle something personally interesting and/or fulfilling while also potentially benefiting the company. This is different from a sabbatical because you will still be working full-time and the project must be work-related and have clearly defined deliverables. The purpose of these projects is to give you uninterrupted time to explore and learn something or work on a problem that has been tugging at you. The end result should have the potential to benefit the company in some way, though we may or may not decide to implement a personal project once it is complete. Note that personal projects are optional, but strongly encouraged.

## Requirements

In order to pursue a personal project, you will need to propose a project, schedule the time, and provide deliverables. While working on a personal project, that will be your top priority, meaning you do not need to work on other company tasks for that month aside from unblocking other people on the team, if needed. You will still be expected on team calls and to provide weekly email updates on the project. On the team call following the completion of the project time you will present your project and deliverables.

## Proposals

Everyone can propose a personal project once per year. All proposals need to be written out, shared with the entire team for review, and they should be submitted at least 2 months prior to the time you wish to do the work. The entirety of the project should be self-contained, with no additional preparatory time or requiring the efforts of others on the team.

The proposal should consist of:

- A clear goal that is achievable in 4 weeks
- An outline for how the 4 weeks will be spent (planning, research, implementation, etc.)
- A list of deliverables (e.g. working prototype, 4 blog posts, strategy document, etc.)
- Proposed timeframe (find a time where your general absence will not negatively affect the company)

Proposals will be reviewed by the team and discussed on a team call. The final approval and scheduling will be done by the CEO.
