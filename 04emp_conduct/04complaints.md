# Complaint Procedure
It is the policy of Osio Labs to maintain a harmonious workplace environment that is free of threats to the health, safety, and wellbeing of the people who work here. We encourage our employees to express concerns about work-related issues, including workplace communication, interpersonal conflict, and other working conditions.

We strongly encourage the reporting of all instances of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. If you believe you have experienced or witnessed harassment or discrimination according to our Harassment Policy or otherwise, even if it’s not about something that’s explicitly covered in our written policies, promptly report the incident to the CEO. If you believe it would be inappropriate to discuss the matter with the CEO, you may bypass the CEO and report directly to the Board.

After receiving a complaint, we may hold a meeting with the employee and any other individuals who may assist in the investigation or resolution of the issue. All discussions related to the grievance will be limited to those involved with, and who can assist with, resolving the issue. Any reported allegations of harassment or discrimination will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, and impartially. To the maximum extent possible, confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigatory process. 

Osio Labs expressly prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports discrimination or harassment, or assists in investigating such charges. Any form of retaliation is considered a direct violation of this policy and, like discrimination or harassment itself, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
