# Company History
In 2006 the Drupal consulting company [Lullabot](http://lullabot.com/) was started by Jeff Robbins and Matt Westgate. They hired expert Drupal developers with excellent communication skills to share their knowledge, help grow the Drupal community, and provide technical strategy and answers to their consulting clients. They started the first Drupal podcast and started doing Drupal workshops and training.

In 2010 Lullabot launched an online Drupal tutorial service, Drupalize.Me, to extend the training they had been doing through workshops and DVDs.

In 2015 Lullabot spun off the Drupalize.Me team to create a new company focused solely on education, called Lullabot Education. Lullabot Education continues running Drupalize.Me and the long tradition of teaching people how to build their own websites.

## Where Did The Name Come From?
“Lullabot” is a combination of the words “lullaby” and “robot.” When Jeff and Matt were naming the original company, they wanted a name that combined Jeff’s background in music and Matt’s background in Zen with the technical work that they were both doing. They wanted a name that juxtaposed organic, emotional, and human elements with the digital, mechanical, logical work. With Jeff’s background in music and design, he also wanted something that was iconic and “looked good on a t-shirt.” The happy sleeping robot logo was born at the same time as the name and, sure enough, our t-shirts, stickers, and temporary tattoos have been popular with adults and kids alike. The name reminds us to have fun and not take ourselves too seriously.

Osio Labs simply extended this by emphasizing the educational aspect of our work, while keeping the underlying spirit of Lullabot.
