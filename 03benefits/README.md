# Employee Benefits

The following section lists Lullabot Education's benefits and describes each. If you have specific questions about a benefit, feel free to email the CEO or our Insperity representative.

## Wait, what's Insperity?
For our U.S. employees we have partnered with Insperity to provide payroll and employee benefits. This means that for the U.S. folks Insperity will handle most of your employee paperwork and serve as the support system for your benefits plans.

## Full-time and part-time
The many of our benefits apply equally to both full- and part-time employees, but not all do. A full-time employee works 30 or more hours per week on average, while part-time employees work 20 hours a week on average. Where benefits are different based on number of hours worked, this will be indicated in the benefit using the terms full-time and part-time. If there is no reference made to the status of hours, then the benefit applies to all employees.

## Summary of benefits
This is a quick overview of the main benefits we offer. You will find details for each of these in the rest of this section of the handbook.

**[Leave](https://github.com/LullabotEducation/emphandbook/blob/master/03benefits/02leave.md)**

We provide 5 weeks (25 days) of paid vacation and 10 paid holidays per year (based on your country of residence). We also offer 6 weeks of paid parental leave, with an optional, additional 6 weeks of unpaid leave. There are other forms of leave as well, including time for bereavement, conference attendance, jury duty, and military service. Personal Days can be used for situations that do not fall under another leave type (e.g. sick days, family need, moving, household emergencies) and these days are unlimited.

**[Insurance](https://github.com/LullabotEducation/emphandbook/blob/master/03benefits/03insurance.md)**

We provide medical, dental, and vision coverage in the US, and will arrange for equivalent coverage in other countries as needed. We also pay for $50,000 life insurance coverage, and you may elect to take more. Our disability plan goes into effect if you are unfit for work for more than 2 weeks and will cover 60% of your salary.

**[Retirement](https://github.com/LullabotEducation/emphandbook/blob/master/03benefits/04retirement.md)**

We have 401(k) plans set up in the US, and will match up to 4% of your own retirement contributions. We provide equivalent matching for non-US plans.

**[Tech and Office Stipend](https://github.com/LullabotEducation/emphandbook/blob/master/03benefits/05tech_stipend.md)**

We give you $200 per month, tax free, for buying office equipment (computers, desks, cell phones, etc.) and software for work.

**[Education](https://github.com/LullabotEducation/emphandbook/blob/master/03benefits/06education.md)**

Everyone gets $1000 per year to spend on education expenses of your choice. This does not need to be directly related to your work, and covers courses, conferences, books, etc. Through Insperity, US employees can also use up to $1500 per year on college tuition and $500 per year of continuing education expenses. (Non-US employees can work out a similar plan, as needed.)

**[Travel](https://github.com/LullabotEducation/emphandbook/blob/master/03benefits/07travel_budget.md)**

We cover all work-related travel expenses, including conferences, meetings, and retreats. For continuing education events, we may cover all or part of the travel, depending on circumstances and budget. We also pay for flight upgrades that fall within certain guidelines.
