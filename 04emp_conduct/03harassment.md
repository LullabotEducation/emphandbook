# Harassment Policy
Osio Labs is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect. We expressly prohibit discrimination and all forms of employee harassment based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability (physical or mental), citizenship, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and any other characteristic that differentiates someone.

We do not tolerate harassment of employees, contractors or people that we interact with in any form. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or jokes related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.

Sexual harassment is a form of discrimination and is prohibited by law. For purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Unwelcome sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; (2) submission or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions; or, (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

Sexual harassment may include a range of behaviors and may involve individuals of the same or different gender. These behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Unwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors
- Sexual or derogatory jokes, comments, or innuendo
- Unwelcome physical interaction
- Insulting or obscene comments or gestures
- Offensive email, voicemail, or text messages
- Suggestive or sexually explicit posters, calendars, photographs, graffiti, or cartoons
- Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances
- Visual conduct that includes leering, making sexual gestures, or displaying of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters
- Verbal sexual advances or propositions
- Physical conduct that includes touching, assaulting, or impeding or blocking movements
- Any other visual, verbal, or physical conduct or behavior deemed inappropriate by the company
