# Goals and Values
Our long-term vision is to change online learning for web development, making it more effective and accessible for everyone. This includes crafting content and tools that ease learning, as well as addressing barriers that deny people access to learning resources.

Part of achieving our vision is creating a company where great things can happen. We are an [open books company](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercarbonara/2017/04/18/what-small-business-owners-need-to-know-about-open-book-management/#3fcfeb44432a) and we are very transparent with all aspects of our business, from the daily work everyone is doing to the financial forecast for the coming year. We do this so that everyone at the company understands how our business works and their impact on it. All employees are involved in business decisions at some level.

We take our core values very seriously. They're the underpinning for what we do, and more importantly, how we do it. Every major company decision and goal is measured against our values. 

**Do great work**

We value craftsmanship and set high standards for our work. We're proud of the clear, well-crafted products we create, as well as our professional demeanor.

**Feed creativity**

Creativity creates space for innovative ideas and inventive solutions. We embrace the full creative process, which includes failing, learning, and trying again.

**Spread happiness**

We believe in the power of happiness. We encourage playfulness, positivity, and kindness in everything we do.

**Work together**

We keep open minds and listen to each other to find common ground and consensus. We support and help each other in ways that make our entire team stronger.

**Build trust**

We build trust through openness, respect, and forgiveness. We treat each other like adults and genuinely care for people. We value our distributed work environment, and we trust our colleagues to make the best use of that flexibility to cultivate the best life balance for them.

**Empower people**

We learn by sharing our knowledge, and we help others do the same. We strive to create a space that empowers everyone to be and do what they want.

**Care for our customers**

We work hard to serve our customers well. We meet them where they are, and we believe that being aware of, and responsive to, our customersâ€™ needs is an integral part of what we do.
