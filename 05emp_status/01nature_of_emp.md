# Nature of Employment
Employment with Osio Labs is "at-will." This means employees are free to resign at any time, with or without cause, and Osio Labs may terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. As an at-will employee, it is not guaranteed, in any manner, that you will be employed with Osio Labs for any set period of time.

The policies set forth in this employee handbook are the policies that are in effect at the time of publication. They may be amended, modified, or terminated at any time by Osio Labs, except for the policy on at-will employment, which may be modified only by a signed, written agreement between the CEO and the employee at issue. No representative of the company, other than the CEO, has the authority to change the terms of the at-will relationship. Nothing in this handbook may be construed as creating a promise of future benefits or a binding contract between Osio Labs and any of its employees.
