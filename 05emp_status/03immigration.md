# Immigration Law Compliance
Osio Labs is committed to employing United States citizens and non-citizens who are authorized to work in the United States, and does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of citizenship or national origin.

In compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as amended, each new employee who resides in the U.S., as a condition of employment, must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and employment eligibility. Former employees who are rehired must also complete the form if they have not completed an I-9 with Osio Labs within the past three years, or if their previous I-9 is no longer retained or valid.

Similar documents for international employees will be requested as needed.
