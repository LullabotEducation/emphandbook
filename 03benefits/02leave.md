# Leave
We provide many forms for leave from work. This breaks it all down.

## Paid time off
There are multiple forms of paid days off. Vacation time and personal days (PD) are for the employee to choose, while conference days are used for specific events.

Paid time off is paid at your base pay rate at the time of the absence. It does not include overtime or any special forms of compensation such as incentives, commissions, or bonuses. It may be used in minimum increments of one-half day. Employees with an unexpected need (i.e. sudden illness or emergency) for a personal day should notify the CEO as early as possible.

Work-related accidents and illness are covered by Workers' Compensation Insurance, pursuant to the requirements of the laws in the U.S. state(s) in which Osio Labs operates. The paid time off policy outlined here does not apply to those illnesses or injuries that are covered by an applicable Workers' Compensation policy.

### Vacation
All full-time employees in the company receive 5 weeks (25 days or 200 hours) of paid vacation time. This is intended to only be truly used for vacations (see PD below for things like sick leave). You earn 2.083 days (16.67 hours) of vacation for each month you have worked. Vacation time is "use it or lose it." You must use all 25 days by the end of the calendar year. If you were to leave the company at any time during the year you could either be entitled to a payout of the vacation you earned but did not use, or a withholding if you used more vacation than you had accrued.

Part-time employees receive half the amount of leave in total hours (100 instead of 200), which provides 5 weeks (25 4-hour days) of paid vacation time.

### Personal days (PD)
Personal days are used for the "un-fun" things in life. You may use PD time for things like being sick, when a family member is sick, household emergencies, moving, and the like. If you need more than 2 consecutive days of PD, or if you are not sure if something is appropriate for PD time, you should talk with the CEO. There is no set limit to these days but usage is tracked, just like vacation days are.

### Conference days
When you are attending a work-related conference or event, you are considered out of the office (OOO) on business travel, but you are expected to check, and be responsive to, email at least twice a day. If you don’t wish to check email or deal with any work-related issues during the conference, you can use vacation time to be fully OOO.

## Holidays
We offer everyone 10 paid holidays. To enable everyone to celebrate with their friends and family, we recognize the public holidays that are specific to where our employees live and work. Employees are able to switch any of their holidays to another day if needed. To switch out holidays, please email your request to the team.

## Flexible work week
You are always able to take advantage of flex time by lengthening or shortening individual days to accommodate your workload and external needs. You just need to communicate alterations to your normal work times to the team as they occur.

In addition to regular flex time, you may also opt to choose a different structure to your regular, recurring work week. For instance, you could choose to work longer days (10 hours per day) Monday–Thursday and then have every Friday off. Any structural changes to your work week need to be discussed with the team and will still need to accommodate being present for regular phone calls and other regular weekly obligations.

## Parental leave
Welcoming a new child to your home is an amazing and joyous occasion! We would like to support you by providing additional time to bond with your new child, adjust to a new home life, and balance your professional obligations.
 
Parental leave is available for both the birth of your own child and the placement of a child due to adoption or foster care. This policy will run concurrently with the legal requirements of each country, with the [U.S. Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/benefits-leave/fmla.htm) for U.S. employees. At the end of your leave, you will return to your job or an equivalent with the same salary, benefits, working conditions and seniority.
 
Employees who have been with the company for six months or more are eligible for the following:

- Six weeks time off, fully paid
- Six weeks additional time off, unpaid
- Vacation can be used in place of any unpaid leave
- If both parents are employees of Osio Labs, they are limited to a combined total of 12 weeks leave.
 
You must notify the CEO of your desire to use this leave, and formulate a plan for the days you will take off, a minimum of 60 days prior to the planned arrival date so that we can plan accordingly.

## Bereavement leave
Bereavement leave provides paid time off for eligible employees in the event of a death in their immediate family. An immediate family member for purposes of our bereavement leave policy includes the following:

- Spouse or Live-in life partner
- Child (including foster children and step-children)
- Parent (including legal guardian and step-parent)
- In-laws (including mother- and father-in-laws and brother- and sister-in-laws)
- Grandparent
- Grandchild
- Sibling

Eligible employees are entitled to 3 days paid time off for a death in the immediate family. Osio Labs understands the deep impact that death can have on an individual or a family. Therefore, additional unpaid time off may be granted at the company's discretion. Such arrangements must be approved by the CEO.

All employees may take up to 1 day off with pay to attend the funeral of a close, non-family member. This time off will be considered by the CEO on a case-by-case basis.

To be eligible for paid time off for bereavement, employees should notify the CEO at the earliest opportunity so that the CEO can arrange coverage for the employee's absence.

## Jury duty
Osio Labs encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities by serving jury duty when required. Osio Labs will pay regular salary for the first 3 days of jury duty, and after that jury duty will be paid only if required by applicable state or national law.

If requested, we will work with the employee to determine an appropriate strategy for compensation during jury duty. Solutions may include the use of PD, an unpaid leave of absence, 50% pay, or some combination.

Please be sure to communicate your jury duty requirements with the CEO as they arise.

## Military leave
Osio Labs grants employees time off of work for service in the uniformed services in accordance with the U.S. Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).

All employees requesting time off for military service must provide advance notice of military service to the CEO, unless military necessity prevents such notice or it is otherwise impossible or unreasonable. Continuation of health insurance benefits is available during military leave subject to the terms and conditions of the group health plan and applicable law.

Employees are eligible for reemployment for up to five (5) years from the date their military leave began. The period an individual has to make application for reemployment or report back to work after military service is based on time spent on military duty. For service of fewer than 31 days, the service member must return at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled work period on the first full day after release from service, taking into account safe travel home plus an eight-hour rest period. For service of more than 30 days but fewer than 181 days, the service member must submit an application for reemployment within 14 days of release from service. For service of more than 180 days, an application for reemployment must be submitted within 90 days of release from service.

Employees who qualify for reemployment will return to active employment at a pay level and status equal to that which they would have attained had they not entered military service. They will be treated as though they were continuously employed for purposes of determining benefits based on length of service.

Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the CEO.

## Unpaid leave
All regular employees employed for a minimum of 90 days are eligible to apply for an unpaid personal leave of absence. Employees must exhaust all paid time off before taking unpaid leave. To apply, you should submit a request in writing to the CEO. Requests for unpaid personal leave may be denied or granted for any reason. Osio Labs reserves the right to terminate employment for any reason during the leave of absence.

The employee is required to return from the unpaid leave on the originally scheduled return date. If the employee is unable to return, he or she must request an extension of the leave in writing. If and extension of leave is declined, the employee must then return to work on the originally scheduled return date or be considered to have voluntarily resigned from his or her employment.

### Effect on benefits
During unpaid leave current coverage will automatically continue for 6 weeks for Medical, Dental, Vision, Life, and Disability benefits. Beyond 6 weeks of unpaid leave, the employee may choose to continue coverage by paying the full premium amount or discontinue coverage.

During unpaid leave there is no accrual of paid days off (e.g. vacation) or tech stipend (PEX), holidays are not paid, and continuing education benefits are suspended. Time while on leave is counted as service credit in determining eligibility for those benefits that are dependent upon length of service.
