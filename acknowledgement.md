# Acknowledgment
I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Osio Labs Employee Handbook. I understand that this handbook replaces any and all prior verbal and written communications regarding Osio Labs working conditions, policies, procedures, appeal processes, and benefits.

I have read and understand the contents of this handbook and will act in accord with these policies and procedures as a condition of my employment with Osio Labs. I understand that if I have questions or concerns at any time about the handbook I will consult the CEO for clarification.
