# Company History
In 2006 the Drupal consulting company [Lullabot](http://lullabot.com/) was started by Jeff Robbins and Matt Westgate. They hired expert Drupal developers with excellent communication skills to share their knowledge, help grow the Drupal community, and provide technical strategy and answers to their consulting clients. They started the first Drupal podcast and started doing Drupal workshops and training. In 2010 Lullabot launched an online Drupal tutorial service, Drupalize.Me, to extend the training they had been doing through workshops and DVDs.

In 2015 Lullabot spun off the Drupalize.Me team to create a new company focused solely on education, called Lullabot Education. We used the Lullabot Education name for the first 3 years of our existance and in 2019 we changed the name to Osio Labs.

## Where Did The Name Come From?
Osio is a made up word from the acronym for Open Source Inside Out. We are proud supporters of open source and collaboration is part of our DNA. We also like to constantly experiment and try new ways to do things better, from the tutorials we create to the way we run our business. The world of open source is our lab.
